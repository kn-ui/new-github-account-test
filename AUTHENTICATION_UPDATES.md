# Authentication System Updates

## Overview
The authentication system has been updated to properly sync users between Clerk and Firebase, fix login navigation issues, and support all user roles.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Login Page Navigation Issue
**File:** `src/pages/Login.tsx`
- **Issue:** After successful login, users remained on the login page instead of being redirected to the dashboard
- **Solution:** Removed the timeout delay and immediately navigate to dashboard after successful login
- **Result:** Users are now properly redirected to the dashboard upon successful authentication

### 2. Enabled Temporary Signup Functionality
**File:** `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- **Change:** Re-enabled the signup function for testing purposes
- **Implementation:** 
  - Uses the backend API to create users in both Clerk and Firebase
  - Automatically signs in users after successful account creation
  - Provides proper error handling for duplicate accounts

### 3. Added Support for All User Roles with Permission-Based Access
**Files:** `src/pages/UserManager.tsx`, `src/pages/Signup.tsx`
- **Roles Supported:**
  - `student` - Access to courses and learning materials
  - `teacher` - Can create and manage courses
  - `admin` - System administration capabilities
  - `super_admin` - Full system access including admin management
  
- **Role-Based Permissions in UserManager:**
  - **Admin users can:**
    - Add/edit/delete students and teachers only
    - Cannot modify admin or super_admin users
    - Cannot create admin or super_admin accounts
  
  - **Super Admin users can:**
    - Add/edit/delete ALL user types (students, teachers, admins, super_admins)
    - Full control over user management
    - Only role that can create other admins and super_admins
  
- **Security Features:**
  - Users cannot delete their own accounts
  - Role options in dropdown menus are filtered based on current user's role
  - Edit/Delete buttons are disabled for unauthorized actions
  - Password field added to UserManager for custom passwords
  - Default passwords are assigned by role if not specified

### 4. User Sync Between Clerk and Firebase
**How it Works:**
1. **On Sign In:**
   - User authenticates with Clerk
   - System checks for existing Firebase profile by UID
   - If not found, checks by email
   - If still not found, creates minimal profile in Firebase
   - Syncs user data between both systems

2. **On User Creation (Admin/Signup):**
   - Creates user in Clerk with specified credentials
   - Creates corresponding profile in Firebase
   - Assigns appropriate role and permissions

## Authentication Flow

### Login Flow
1. User enters email and password on login page
2. Credentials are validated against Clerk
3. On success, Clerk session is established
4. Firebase profile is fetched/created if needed
5. User is redirected to dashboard based on their role

### Signup Flow (Temporary)
1. User fills out signup form with:
   - Full name
   - Email
   - Password
   - Role selection
2. System creates user in backend (Clerk + Firebase)
3. User is automatically signed in
4. Redirected to dashboard

### Admin User Creation Flow
1. Admin accesses UserManager page
2. Clicks "Add User" and fills form:
   - Display name
   - Email
   - Role
   - Optional custom password
3. Backend creates user in both Clerk and Firebase
4. Default passwords by role (if not specified):
   - Student: `student123`
   - Teacher: `teacher123`
   - Admin: `admin123`
   - Super Admin: `superadmin123`

## Backend Integration

The backend (`server/src/controllers/userController.ts`) handles:
- Creating users in Clerk via API
- Syncing user data to Firebase
- Assigning default passwords based on role
- Development mode support (bypasses Clerk in dev if not configured)

## Important Notes

1. **Temporary Signup:** The signup form is enabled temporarily for testing. In production, it should be disabled and users should be created only by administrators.

2. **Password Policy:** Clerk password policies are bypassed using `skip_password_checks: true` to allow simple default passwords.

3. **Role-based Routing:** After login, users are automatically routed to their role-specific dashboard:
   - Students → Student Dashboard
   - Teachers → Teacher Dashboard
   - Admins → Admin Dashboard
   - Super Admins → Super Admin Dashboard

4. **Session Management:** 
   - Clerk handles session tokens
   - Tokens are persisted for API authentication
   - Firebase profiles are synced on each login

## Testing the Authentication

### Test Accounts
You can create test accounts using either:
1. The signup page at `/signup`
2. The UserManager page (admin access required)

### Test Scenarios
1. **New User Signup:** Create account via signup page
2. **Admin User Creation:** Use UserManager to create users
3. **Login with Existing User:** Test login redirect
4. **Role-based Access:** Verify correct dashboard loads per role

## Security Considerations

- Passwords should be strengthened for production
- Signup should be disabled for public access in production
- Admin creation should require proper authorization
- Consider implementing 2FA for admin roles
- Regular security audits recommended

## Future Improvements

1. Implement password reset functionality
2. Add email verification for new accounts
3. Enhance role permission system
4. Add audit logging for user actions
5. Implement session timeout controls
6. Add support for social login providers
