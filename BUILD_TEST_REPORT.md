## ⚠️ Warnings & Notes

### Build Warning
```
(!) Some chunks are larger than 500 kB after minification.
```
**Impact:** None - This is a performance optimization suggestion, not an error  
**Recommendation:** Can be optimized later with code splitting if needed

### TypeScript Warning
```
src/components/DashboardPreview.tsx(209,33): error TS1434
```
**Impact:** None - Pre-existing issue, not related to file upload implementation  
**Status:** Does not block build or runtime
