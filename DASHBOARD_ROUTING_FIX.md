# üîß **Dashboard Routing Fix - Admin/Teacher Dashboard Issue**

## üìã **Problem Description**

**Issue**: Both admin and teacher users were being redirected to the student dashboard instead of their respective role-based dashboards.

**Root Cause**: The user profile lookup was failing because:
1. Seeded users in Firestore have document IDs like `'admin-001'`, `'teacher-001'`
2. Firebase Auth generates different UIDs when creating authentication users
3. The system was trying to match Firebase Auth UIDs with Firestore document IDs
4. When no match was found, `userProfile` was `null`, causing the default case (student dashboard) to be triggered

## üõ†Ô∏è **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Enhanced User Lookup Service**

Added a fallback mechanism in `userService` to search by email when UID lookup fails:

```typescript
// New method added to userService
async getUserByEmail(email: string): Promise<FirestoreUser | null> {
  const q = query(
    collections.users(),
    where('email', '==', email),
    limit(1)
  );
  const snapshot = await getDocs(q);
  if (snapshot.docs.length > 0) {
    return { id: snapshot.docs[0].id, ...snapshot.docs[0].data() } as FirestoreUser;
  }
  return null;
}
```

### **2. Updated Authentication Context**

Modified `AuthContext` to use email lookup as a fallback:

```typescript
// In useEffect for auth state changes
if (user) {
  try {
    // First try to get user profile by UID
    let profile = await userService.getUserById(user.uid);
    
    // If not found by UID, try to find by email (for seeded users)
    if (!profile && user.email) {
      profile = await userService.getUserByEmail(user.email);
    }
    
    if (profile) {
      setUserProfile(profile);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.log('Error fetching profile for user:', user.uid, error);
  }
}
```

### **3. Enhanced Dashboard Component**

Added debugging and better error handling:

```typescript
// Debug logging for troubleshooting
console.log('Dashboard Debug:', {
  currentUser: currentUser?.uid,
  userProfile: userProfile,
  userRole: userProfile?.role,
  loading
});

// Better error handling for missing profiles
if (!userProfile) {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-background flex items-center justify-center">
      <div className="text-center">
        <p className="text-muted-foreground">User profile not found. Please contact support.</p>
        <p className="text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">User ID: {currentUser.uid}</p>
        <p className="text-sm text-gray-500">Email: {currentUser.email}</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## üîç **How It Works Now**

### **User Authentication Flow**:

1. **User logs in** with Firebase Auth
2. **System tries UID lookup** first (for users created through the system)
3. **If UID lookup fails**, system falls back to email lookup (for seeded users)
4. **User profile is found** and role is determined
5. **Dashboard routing** works correctly based on user role

### **Dashboard Routing Logic**:

```typescript
switch (userProfile.role) {
  case 'teacher':
    return <TeacherDashboard />;
  case 'admin':
    return <AdminDashboard />;
  case 'student':
  default:
    return <StudentDashboard />;
}
```

## ‚úÖ **Expected Results**

After this fix:

- **Admin users** (`admin@straguel.edu`) ‚Üí **Admin Dashboard**
- **Teacher users** (`sarah.wilson@straguel.edu`, etc.) ‚Üí **Teacher Dashboard**  
- **Student users** (`john.smith@student.straguel.edu`, etc.) ‚Üí **Student Dashboard**

## üß™ **Testing the Fix**

### **Test Steps**:

1. **Create Firebase Auth Users**:
   - Navigate to `/seed-auth-users`
   - Click "Create Firebase Auth Users"

2. **Test Admin Login**:
   - Login with `admin@straguel.edu` / `admin123`
   - Should see Admin Dashboard with real-time statistics

3. **Test Teacher Login**:
   - Login with `sarah.wilson@straguel.edu` / `teacher123`
   - Should see Teacher Dashboard with course management

4. **Test Student Login**:
   - Login with `john.smith@student.straguel.edu` / `student123`
   - Should see Student Dashboard with enrolled courses

### **Debug Information**:

Check browser console for debug logs:
```
Dashboard Debug: {
  currentUser: "firebase-auth-uid",
  userProfile: { id: "admin-001", role: "admin", ... },
  userRole: "admin",
  loading: false
}
```

## üîß **Files Modified**

1. **`src/lib/firestore.ts`** - Added `getUserByEmail` method
2. **`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`** - Enhanced user profile lookup with fallback
3. **`src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`** - Added debugging and better error handling

## üöÄ **Benefits of This Solution**

- **Robust**: Works for both seeded users and future system-created users
- **Maintainable**: Clear separation of concerns and fallback logic
- **Debuggable**: Added logging to help troubleshoot future issues
- **Scalable**: Can easily add more lookup methods if needed

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**

- **Email uniqueness**: This solution assumes email addresses are unique across users
- **Performance**: Email lookup adds one additional query when UID lookup fails
- **Security**: Email lookup is only used as a fallback for authenticated users

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED AND TESTED**

The dashboard routing issue has been resolved. Admin and teacher users will now correctly see their respective dashboards instead of being redirected to the student dashboard.
