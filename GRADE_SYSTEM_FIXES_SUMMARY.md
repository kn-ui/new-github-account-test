# Grade System Fixes Summary

## Date: 2025-10-19

This document summarizes all the fixes implemented for the grade system and related features.

## 1. Fixed Letter Grade Assignment and Loading Performance in AdminCourseGrades.tsx

### Issues Fixed:
- **Letter grade assignment**: Fixed the grade calculation logic to correctly map percentages to letter grades
- **Performance issue**: Improved loading state to show a proper loading indicator instead of "No enrolled students found" message

### Changes Made:
- Updated `computeLetter` function to use the shared `calculateLetterGrade` utility
- Added proper loading spinner with "Loading student grades..." message
- Fixed percentage calculation to exclude bonus points (otherTotal) from the percentage but include them in final points
- Added default grade ranges fallback when settings fail to load
- Improved error handling with proper toast notifications

## 2. Implemented Automatic Deletion of Activity Logs Older Than a Week

### Feature Added:
- Automatic cleanup of activity_logs collection to prevent database bloat
- Runs once per day when a user logs in

### Implementation:
- Added cleanup trigger in `AuthContext.tsx` during login
- Uses localStorage to track last cleanup date to avoid multiple runs per day
- Leverages existing `activityLogService.cleanupOldLogs()` function
- Runs asynchronously in the background without blocking user interaction

## 3. Hygraph File Deletion (Already Implemented)

### Verified Implementation:
- **Course Materials**: Files are deleted from Hygraph when materials are deleted
- **Assignments**: Attachment files are deleted when assignments are deleted  
- **Blogs**: Images are deleted when blog posts are deleted

### How It Works:
- Uses `deleteHygraphAsset` function from `hygraphUpload.ts`
- Extracts asset ID from Hygraph URL and calls deletion API
- Handles errors gracefully without blocking the deletion of database records

## 4. Fixed GPA Calculation in AdminStudentGrades.tsx

### Issues Fixed:
- GPA calculation now properly validates grade points are within 0-4.0 range
- Only includes published grades in GPA calculation
- Handles invalid/NaN values gracefully

### Changes Made:
- Added validation to ensure grade points are within valid range (0-4.0)
- Filter out unpublished grades from GPA calculation
- Created shared `calculateGPA` utility for consistent calculations
- Added proper rounding to 2 decimal places

## 5. Fixed Data Consistency Across Grade-Related Pages

### Created Shared Grade Utilities (`src/lib/gradeUtils.ts`):
- `calculateLetterGrade`: Unified letter grade calculation from points/percentage
- `calculateGPA`: Consistent GPA calculation with validation
- `getDefaultGradeRanges`: Default grade configuration
- `loadGradeRanges`: Async loading with fallback to defaults
- Helper functions for formatting and styling grades

### Pages Updated:
- **AdminCourseGrades.tsx**: Uses shared `calculateLetterGrade` utility
- **AdminStudentGrades.tsx**: Uses shared utilities for letter grades and GPA
- **StudentGrades.tsx**: Shows consistent grade data
- **TeacherCourseDetail.tsx**: Displays grades consistently
- **CourseDetail.tsx**: Shows student grades with proper calculations

## 6. Grade Ranges Configuration

### Default Grade Ranges:
```
A+: 97-100 (4.0)
A:  93-96  (4.0)
A-: 90-92  (3.7)
B+: 87-89  (3.3)
B:  83-86  (3.0)
B-: 80-82  (2.7)
C+: 77-79  (2.3)
C:  73-76  (2.0)
C-: 70-72  (1.7)
D+: 67-69  (1.3)
D:  63-66  (1.0)
D-: 60-62  (0.7)
F:  0-59   (0.0)
```

## Key Improvements:

1. **Consistent Calculations**: All grade-related pages now use the same calculation logic through shared utilities
2. **Better Performance**: Parallel API calls and improved loading states
3. **Data Validation**: Proper validation of grade points and percentages
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and error handling throughout
5. **Database Maintenance**: Automatic cleanup of old activity logs
6. **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup of uploaded files when content is deleted

## Testing Recommendations:

1. **Grade Calculation**: Test with various point combinations to verify letter grades are assigned correctly
2. **GPA Calculation**: Verify GPA is calculated correctly across semesters and years
3. **Activity Log Cleanup**: Check that old logs are deleted after a week
4. **File Deletion**: Upload and delete course materials, assignments, and blogs to verify Hygraph files are deleted
5. **Loading States**: Check that all grade pages show proper loading indicators
6. **Grade Publishing**: Verify that unpublished grades are excluded from student views and GPA calculations
