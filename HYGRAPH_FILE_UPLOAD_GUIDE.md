- ✅ **File Validation**: Pre-upload validation for file size and type
- ✅ **Asset Deletion**: Remove assets from Hygraph when no longer needed
- ✅ **File Utilities**: Format file sizes, get extensions, validate types

### 2. **Teacher Assignments** (`src/pages/TeacherAssignments.tsx`)
- ✅ Upload assignment attachments (max 10MB)
- ✅ Supported formats: PDF, DOC, DOCX, PPT, PPTX, XLS, XLSX, TXT, ZIP
- ✅ Real-time upload progress with toast notifications
- ✅ File size display and validation feedback
- ✅ Alternative: Add external links as attachments

### 3. **Teacher Course Materials** (`src/pages/TeacherCourseMaterials.tsx`)
- ✅ Upload course materials (max 50MB)
- ✅ Supported formats: PDF, DOC, DOCX, PPT, PPTX, XLS, XLSX, TXT, ZIP
- ✅ Real-time upload feedback
- ✅ Option to use direct URLs instead of uploading
- ✅ File validation and error handling

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables Required

Make sure you have these in your `.env` file:

```env
# Hygraph Configuration
VITE_HYGRAPH_ENDPOINT=https://api-us-east-1.hygraph.com/v2/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/master
VITE_HYGRAPH_TOKEN=your_hygraph_permanent_auth_token
```

### Getting Your Hygraph Credentials

1. **Go to your Hygraph project**: https://app.hygraph.com/
2. **Get the API Endpoint**:
   - Go to Project Settings → API Access
   - Copy the "Content API" endpoint URL
   
3. **Create a Permanent Auth Token**:
   - Go to Project Settings → API Access → Permanent Auth Tokens
   - Click "Create Token"
   - Name it (e.g., "File Upload Token")
   - Set permissions:
     - ✅ Read/Create/Update/Delete for `Asset` model
     - ✅ Publish/Unpublish permissions
   - Copy the token (save it securely!)

## 📝 Usage Examples

### For Teachers - Uploading Assignment Attachments

1. Navigate to **Assignments** page
2. Click "**Create Assignment**"
3. Fill in assignment details
4. In the "**Attachment**" field:
   - Click "Choose File"
   - Select your file (max 10MB)
   - File will show: `filename.pdf (2.5 MB)`
5. Click "**Create Assignment**"
6. File uploads automatically to Hygraph
7. Success notification: "File uploaded successfully: filename.pdf"

### For Teachers - Uploading Course Materials

1. Navigate to **Course Materials** page
2. Click "**Create Material**"
3. Select material type: "**Document**"
4. Upload file (max 50MB) OR paste a direct URL
5. Click "**Add Material**"
6. File uploads to Hygraph and URL is stored

## 🔒 Security & Validation

### File Size Limits
- **Assignments**: 10MB maximum
- **Course Materials**: 50MB maximum

### Supported File Types
- Documents: `.pdf`, `.doc`, `.docx`
- Presentations: `.ppt`, `.pptx`
- Spreadsheets: `.xls`, `.xlsx`
- Text: `.txt`
- Archives: `.zip`

### Validation Checks
1. ✅ File size validation before upload
2. ✅ File type validation (MIME type check)
3. ✅ Error handling with user-friendly messages
4. ✅ Upload cancellation on validation failure

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Upload Flow

```
1. User selects file
   ↓
2. File validation (size, type)
   ↓
3. Create FormData with GraphQL mutation
   ↓
4. Upload to Hygraph via multipart request
   ↓
5. Receive asset URL and ID
   ↓
6. Store URL in assignment/material record
   ↓
7. Show success notification
```

### GraphQL Mutation Used

```graphql
mutation UploadAsset($file: Upload!) {
  createAsset(data: { upload: $file }) {
    id
    url
    fileName
    mimeType
    size
  }
}
```

### Upload Method

The implementation uses **multipart/form-data** with the following structure:

```javascript
{
  operations: { query, variables },
  map: { '0': ['variables.file'] },
  '0': <actual file blob>
}
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. **Upload fails with "401 Unauthorized"**
**Solution**: Check your `VITE_HYGRAPH_TOKEN` environment variable
- Make sure the token has proper permissions
- Ensure it's a Permanent Auth Token, not a temporary one

#### 2. **Upload fails with "File size exceeds limit"**
**Solution**: 
- Assignments: Reduce file size below 10MB
- Materials: Reduce file size below 50MB
- Consider compressing PDFs or using file compression tools

#### 3. **"File type not allowed" error**
**Solution**: Only upload supported file types:
- PDF, DOC, DOCX, PPT, PPTX, XLS, XLSX, TXT, ZIP

#### 4. **Upload hangs/times out**
**Solution**:
- Check your internet connection
- Try a smaller file
- Check Hygraph dashboard for service status

## 📊 File Management in Hygraph

### Viewing Uploaded Files
1. Go to Hygraph Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Assets** in the sidebar
3. All uploaded files are listed there
4. Click on any asset to see details

### Deleting Files
Files can be deleted in two ways:
1. **From Hygraph Dashboard**: Manually delete assets
2. **Programmatically**: Use the `deleteAssetFromHygraph()` function

```typescript
import { deleteAssetFromHygraph } from '@/lib/hygraphUpload';

await deleteAssetFromHygraph(assetId);
```

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to consider:

1. **Progress Bar**: Show upload progress percentage
2. **Drag & Drop**: Add drag-and-drop file upload interface
3. **Image Preview**: Show thumbnail previews for uploaded images
4. **Batch Upload**: Allow multiple file uploads at once
5. **File Search**: Search uploaded files by name or type
6. **Version Control**: Keep track of file versions
7. **Access Control**: Set permissions on who can view files

## 📈 Performance Tips

1. **Compress files** before uploading when possible
2. **Use direct URLs** for files already hosted elsewhere
3. **Clean up unused assets** regularly from Hygraph
4. **Monitor storage usage** in Hygraph dashboard
