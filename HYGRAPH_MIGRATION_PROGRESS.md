# Hygraph Migration Progress Report

## Overview
We have successfully started the migration from Firebase Firestore to Hygraph GraphQL CMS. This migration involves replacing the database layer while maintaining the existing Clerk authentication system.

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Dependencies Installation
- ‚úÖ Installed `graphql` and `graphql-request` packages for both frontend and backend
- ‚úÖ Added Hygraph GraphQL client dependencies

### 2. Configuration Setup
- ‚úÖ Created Hygraph client configuration (`src/lib/hygraph.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Created backend Hygraph configuration (`server/src/config/hygraph.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Environment variables configured for Hygraph endpoints and tokens

### 3. GraphQL Operations
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive GraphQL queries and mutations (`src/lib/hygraphOperations.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Created backend GraphQL operations (`server/src/lib/hygraphOperations.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Covered all 18 models with full CRUD operations:
  - AppUser, Course, Enrollment, Assignment, Submission
  - CourseMaterial, Exam, ExamAttempt, Grade, Announcement
  - Event, ForumThread, ForumPost, BlogPost, SupportTicket
  - EditRequest, Certificate, ActivityLog

### 4. Service Layer Implementation
- ‚úÖ Created Hygraph user service (`src/lib/hygraphUserService.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Created backend Hygraph user service (`server/src/services/hygraphUserService.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Implemented all user-related operations:
  - Get users with pagination and filtering
  - Get user by ID, UID, or email
  - Create, update, and delete users
  - Search users and get statistics

### 5. Backend API Updates
- ‚úÖ Updated user controller to use Hygraph instead of Firestore
- ‚úÖ Modified all user-related endpoints:
  - `createUser` - Creates users in both Clerk and Hygraph
  - `getProfile` - Fetches user profile from Hygraph
  - `updateProfile` - Updates user profile in Hygraph
  - `getAllUsers` - Lists users with pagination from Hygraph
  - `searchUsers` - Searches users in Hygraph
  - `updateUserRole` - Updates user role in Hygraph
  - `activateUser`/`deactivateUser` - Manages user status in Hygraph
  - `getUserStats` - Gets user statistics from Hygraph

### 6. Frontend Context Updates
- ‚úÖ Updated `ClerkAuthContext.tsx` to use Hygraph user service
- ‚úÖ Modified user profile management to work with Hygraph
- ‚úÖ Updated all user-related operations in the authentication context

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Changes

### Before (Firebase Firestore)
```
Frontend ‚Üí Clerk Auth ‚Üí Backend API ‚Üí Firestore
```

### After (Hygraph)
```
Frontend ‚Üí Clerk Auth ‚Üí Backend API ‚Üí Hygraph GraphQL
```

## üìä Data Model Mapping

### User Model
- **Firestore**: `users` collection with Firebase UIDs
- **Hygraph**: `AppUser` model with Clerk UIDs
- **Fields**: uid, email, displayName, role, isActive, passwordChanged, dateCreated, dateUpdated

### Role Enumeration
- **Firestore**: String values ('student', 'teacher', 'admin', 'super_admin')
- **Hygraph**: Enum values ('STUDENT', 'TEACHER', 'ADMIN', 'SUPER_ADMIN')

## üîß Environment Variables Required

### Frontend (.env)
```
VITE_HYGRAPH_ENDPOINT=https://api-<region>-<project>.hygraph.com/v2/<project>/master
VITE_HYGRAPH_TOKEN=<your-hygraph-token>
```

### Backend (server/.env)
```
HYGRAPH_ENDPOINT=https://api-<region>-<project>.hygraph.com/v2/<project>/master
HYGRAPH_TOKEN=<your-hygraph-token>
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Complete Course Service**: Create Hygraph course service and update course controller
2. **Complete Assignment Service**: Create Hygraph assignment service and update assignment controller
3. **Complete Exam Service**: Create Hygraph exam service and update exam controller
4. **Update Frontend Components**: Modify components to use new Hygraph services
5. **Test Everything**: Comprehensive testing of all operations
6. **Cleanup**: Remove Firebase dependencies and clean up code
