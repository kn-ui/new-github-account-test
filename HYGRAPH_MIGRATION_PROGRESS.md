## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Changes

### Before (Firebase Firestore)
```
Frontend ‚Üí Clerk Auth ‚Üí Backend API ‚Üí Firestore
```

### After (Hygraph)
```
Frontend ‚Üí Clerk Auth ‚Üí Backend API ‚Üí Hygraph GraphQL
```

## üìä Data Model Mapping

### User Model
- **Firestore**: `users` collection with Firebase UIDs
- **Hygraph**: `AppUser` model with Clerk UIDs
- **Fields**: uid, email, displayName, role, isActive, passwordChanged, dateCreated, dateUpdated

### Role Enumeration
- **Firestore**: String values ('student', 'teacher', 'admin', 'super_admin')
- **Hygraph**: Enum values ('STUDENT', 'TEACHER', 'ADMIN', 'SUPER_ADMIN')

## üîß Environment Variables Required

### Frontend (.env)
```
VITE_HYGRAPH_ENDPOINT=https://api-<region>-<project>.hygraph.com/v2/<project>/master
VITE_HYGRAPH_TOKEN=<your-hygraph-token>
```

### Backend (server/.env)
```
HYGRAPH_ENDPOINT=https://api-<region>-<project>.hygraph.com/v2/<project>/master
HYGRAPH_TOKEN=<your-hygraph-token>
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Complete Course Service**: Create Hygraph course service and update course controller
2. **Complete Assignment Service**: Create Hygraph assignment service and update assignment controller
3. **Complete Exam Service**: Create Hygraph exam service and update exam controller
4. **Update Frontend Components**: Modify components to use new Hygraph services
5. **Test Everything**: Comprehensive testing of all operations
6. **Cleanup**: Remove Firebase dependencies and clean up code
