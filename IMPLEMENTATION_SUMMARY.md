if (uploadResult.success) {
  attachments.push({ type: 'file', url: uploadResult.url, title: fileObj.name });
  toast.success(`File uploaded successfully!`);
}
```

### 3. **Teacher Course Materials - File Uploads**

## 🔄 Migration Comparison

### Before (Firebase)
```typescript
// ❌ Old Firebase approach
const storage = getStorage();
const storageRef = ref(storage, path);
await uploadBytes(storageRef, fileObj);
const url = await getDownloadURL(storageRef);
```

### After (Hygraph)
```typescript
// ✅ New Hygraph approach
const uploadResult = await uploadFileViaGraphQL(fileObj);
const url = uploadResult.url;
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Simpler API
- ✅ Built-in validation
- ✅ Better error handling
- ✅ No Firebase dependency
- ✅ Integrated with Hygraph CMS

## 📊 File Upload Specifications

| Feature | Assignments | Course Materials |
|---------|------------|------------------|
| Max Size | 10MB | 50MB |
| File Types | PDF, DOC, DOCX, PPT, PPTX, XLS, XLSX, TXT, ZIP | Same |
| Validation | ✅ Pre-upload | ✅ Pre-upload |
| Progress | ✅ Toast notifications | ✅ Toast notifications |
| Error Handling | ✅ User-friendly | ✅ User-friendly |
| Alternative | External links | Direct URLs |

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Upload Flow
```
User selects file
    ↓
Validate (size, type)
    ↓
Create GraphQL mutation
    ↓
Upload via multipart request to Hygraph
    ↓
Receive asset URL & ID
    ↓
Store URL in database
    ↓
Show success message
```

### GraphQL Mutation
```graphql
mutation UploadAsset($file: Upload!) {
  createAsset(data: { upload: $file }) {
    id
    url
    fileName
    mimeType
    size
  }
}
```

## 🎯 Testing Results

✅ **Build Status**: SUCCESSFUL

- ✅ `HYGRAPH_FILE_UPLOAD_GUIDE.md` (NEW - Documentation)

## 🔐 Security Features

1. **File Size Validation**
   - Prevents overly large files
   - Different limits for different contexts

   - Only allows approved file types
   - Prevents malicious file uploads

3. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful failures
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Stops submission on upload failure

4. **Token Security**
   - Uses environment variables
   - Permanent auth tokens with specific permissions

## 📝 Required Configuration

Add to your `.env` file:

```env
# Hygraph API Configuration
VITE_HYGRAPH_ENDPOINT=https://api-us-east-1.hygraph.com/v2/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/master
VITE_HYGRAPH_TOKEN=your_permanent_auth_token_here
```

### Getting Hygraph Token
1. Go to Hygraph Dashboard
2. Project Settings → API Access
3. Create Permanent Auth Token
4. Set permissions for Asset model:
   - ✅ Create
   - ✅ Read
   - ✅ Update
   - ✅ Delete
   - ✅ Publish/Unpublish

## 🎨 User Experience Improvements

### Before
- ❌ File upload not working
- ❌ No validation feedback
- ❌ Generic error messages
- ❌ No file size display

### After
- ✅ Working file upload
- ✅ Real-time validation
