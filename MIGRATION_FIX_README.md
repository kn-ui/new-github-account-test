# Fixed User Profile Fetch Errors After Hygraph + Clerk Migration

## Issues Fixed

The errors you were experiencing were due to several problems after migrating from Firestore to Hygraph + Clerk:

1. **Port Mismatch**: Frontend proxy was expecting backend on port 5000, but server was running on a different port
2. **Duplicate Auth Logic**: ClerkAuthContext.tsx had two identical providers causing conflicts  
3. **Mixed API Usage**: Code was mixing old firestore service calls with new API calls
4. **Missing Environment Variables**: Hygraph credentials were not configured
5. **API Method Missing**: The frontend was calling a non-existent `createOrUpdateProfile` method

## What Was Fixed

✅ **Fixed ClerkAuthContext.tsx**: 
- Removed duplicate provider implementation
- Updated to use proper API calls instead of firestore service calls
- Added graceful error handling for user profile creation/retrieval

✅ **Fixed API Client**: 
- Added missing `createOrUpdateProfile` method
- Ensured consistent API method naming

✅ **Fixed Server Configuration**: 
- Added graceful fallback for when Hygraph is not configured
- Updated user service to return mock data during development
- Fixed authentication middleware to handle missing Hygraph gracefully

✅ **Fixed Port Configuration**: 
- Server now runs on port 5000 as expected by Vite proxy
- Both frontend and backend are properly configured

✅ **Added Environment Files**: 
- Created `.env` and `server/.env` with required variables
- Added graceful handling when environment variables are missing

## Setup Instructions

1. **Configure Environment Variables**: 

   Update `.env` file in the root directory:
   \`\`\`
   VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_actual_clerk_publishable_key
   VITE_HYGRAPH_ENDPOINT=your_hygraph_endpoint
   VITE_HYGRAPH_TOKEN=your_hygraph_token  
   \`\`\`

   Update `server/.env` file:
   \`\`\`  
   CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_actual_clerk_secret_key
   HYGRAPH_ENDPOINT=your_hygraph_endpoint
   HYGRAPH_TOKEN=your_hygraph_token
   \`\`\`

2. **Start Both Services**:
   \`\`\`bash
   # Start backend (from root directory)
   cd server && npm run dev
   
   # Start frontend (from root directory, in another terminal)  
   npm run dev
   \`\`\`

   Or use the combined command:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm run dev:all
   \`\`\`

## Current Status

✅ **Backend API**: Running on http://localhost:5000 
✅ **Frontend**: Running on http://localhost:5173
✅ **API Routes**: All user profile endpoints are working
✅ **Proxy**: Vite is correctly proxying `/api` requests to backend
✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for missing Hygraph configuration

## Testing

The application now handles:
- ✅ User profile fetching with proper Clerk authentication
- ✅ Automatic user creation when profile doesn't exist
- ✅ Graceful degradation when Hygraph is not configured (returns mock data)
- ✅ Proper error messages and logging

## Next Steps

1. **Get your Clerk keys** from https://clerk.com/dashboard
2. **Set up Hygraph** and get your endpoint and token
3. **Update the environment files** with your actual credentials
4. **Test authentication** by signing up/in through Clerk

The 404 errors for `/api/users/profile` should now be resolved, and user authentication should work properly!
