# User Profile Fetch Errors - Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Port Mismatch Issue**
- **Problem**: Vite proxy was configured for `localhost:5000` but server was running on `localhost:26053`
- **Fix**: Modified server startup to run on port 5000 to match the Vite proxy configuration

### 2. **Duplicate Auth Provider Code**
- **Problem**: `ClerkAuthContext.tsx` contained duplicate provider implementations (`ClerkAuthProviderInner` and `ClerkAuthProvider`)
- **Fix**: Removed duplicate code and consolidated into single `ClerkAuthProvider`

### 3. **Missing API Method**
- **Problem**: Code was calling `api.createOrUpdateProfile()` method that didn't exist
- **Fix**: Added `createOrUpdateProfile` method to the API client in `src/lib/api.ts`

### 4. **Mixed Service Usage**
- **Problem**: Code was mixing old Firestore service calls with new API calls
- **Fix**: Updated `ClerkAuthContext.tsx` to use only API calls instead of deprecated Firestore services

### 5. **Missing Environment Configuration**
- **Problem**: Hygraph and Clerk credentials were not configured
- **Fix**: Created `.env` files with placeholder values and added graceful fallback for missing Hygraph configuration

### 6. **Error Handling for Missing Services**
- **Problem**: App would crash if Hygraph was not configured
- **Fix**: Added graceful fallback handling in user service to return mock data during development

## Files Modified

1. **`src/contexts/ClerkAuthContext.tsx`**
   - Removed duplicate provider code
   - Fixed API integration to use backend instead of Firestore
   - Improved error handling for user profile creation/fetching

2. **`src/lib/api.ts`**
   - Added missing `createOrUpdateProfile` method

3. **`server/src/services/userService.ts`**
   - Added graceful fallback when Hygraph is not configured
   - Improved error handling for development scenarios

4. **Environment Files**
   - Created `.env` and `server/.env` with placeholder values

## Current Status

✅ **Backend API Running**: Port 5000, responding to health checks
✅ **Frontend Running**: Port 5173, Vite dev server active  
✅ **API Routes Working**: `/api/users/profile` returns proper auth errors
✅ **Proxy Configuration**: Vite proxy correctly forwarding to backend

## Required Setup

To fully resolve the user profile errors, you need to:

### 1. Configure Clerk Authentication
Update `.env` with your actual Clerk keys:
```env
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxxxx
```

Update `server/.env` with your Clerk secret:
```env
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxxxx
```

### 2. Configure Hygraph (Optional for Development)
If you have Hygraph set up, add to both `.env` files:
```env
VITE_HYGRAPH_ENDPOINT=https://api-region.hygraph.com/v2/your-project/master
VITE_HYGRAPH_TOKEN=your-hygraph-token
```

**Note**: The app now works without Hygraph for development - it will use mock data.

### 3. Database Schema (If Using Hygraph)
Ensure your Hygraph project has an `AppUser` model with fields:
- `uid` (String, required)
- `email` (String, required)
- `displayName` (String, required)
- `role` (Enumeration: student, teacher, admin, super_admin)
- `isActive` (Boolean)
- `passwordChanged` (Boolean)

## Testing the Fix

1. **Start Both Services**:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Start backend
   cd server && npm run dev
   
   # Terminal 2: Start frontend  
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Access Application**: Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

3. **Test Authentication**: The user profile fetch errors should now be resolved with proper error handling

## Next Steps

1. **Configure Clerk**: Add your actual Clerk keys to enable authentication
2. **Set up Hygraph**: Configure your Hygraph endpoint and token if you want persistent user data
3. **Test User Registration**: Create test users to verify the full authentication flow
4. **Monitor Logs**: Check browser console and server logs for any remaining issues

The application should now work without the user profile fetch errors, though you'll need to configure authentication services for full functionality.
